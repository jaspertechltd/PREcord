**Learning:** In Compose, users expect the entire row containing a label, description, and Switch to be clickable, not just the switch itself. Making only the switch clickable reduces accessibility and tap targets.
**Action:** Use `.clickable(role = Role.Switch) { onCheckedChange(!checked) }` on the parent `Row` and set the Switch's `onCheckedChange` to `null` to delegate events properly.
